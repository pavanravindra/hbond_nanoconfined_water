# First-principles calculations

### Calculation Scripts

The `scripts` directory contains example input files for the flat-rhombic phase. The sub-directories contain the CP2K input scripts to calculate the lattice energy, the cohesive energy of a quasi-one dimensional chain of water molecules, and the remaining stabilization energy from interactions between chains of water molecules.

### Relaxed Structures

The `structs` directory contains the different relaxed structures that were used to generate the energy values in Figure 1 and Table 1 of the main text. For the hexagonal and pentagonal phases, the alternative chain options are in directories with "v2" and "v3" appended to their names.
