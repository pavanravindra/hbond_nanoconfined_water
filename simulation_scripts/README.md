# Simulation Scripts

This directory contains examples of the i-PI input files for running molecular dynamics simulations of nanoconfined water.

The initial configurations for each phase are in `../structs`.

The three sub-directories here correspond to:

- `classical`: classical molecular dynamics of nanoconfined water with a thermostat
- `dynamical`: classical molecular dynamics of nanoconfined water without a thermostat (for dynamics)
- `quantum`: path integral molecular dynamics of nanoconfined water that account for nuclear quantum effects
